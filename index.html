        Larayne Kaye Glidewell “Lala” was born on May 18, 1981 and passed
        peacefully into the next life on April 26, 2023 at home in San Diego,
        California.
      </p>

      <p>
        Larayne’s life impacted thousands of people for good, with her
        infectious optimism, resilient spirit, and pure heart. While sorrow and
        struggle played a part in her journey, the light of her joy and
        persistent striving shone brighter than any shadows. Larayne’s vocation
        as a postpartum doula, nanny, and general “baby whisperer” took many
        forms and although she never parented children of her own, Larayne’s
        “kids” bear the legacy of her love. Larayne’s physical presence on earth
        ended after a journey with metastatic breast cancer, a disease which
        accompanied her for the last three years of her life, but that she faced
        with courage, tenacity, and a will to either heal from physically, or
        teach everyone around her how to die with grace and gratitude in the
        process.
      </p>

      <p>
        She is survived by her husband, Carter Lee, parents, Mary and Charlie
        Heineke, siblings, Grant and Tamara Glidewell, CJ Heineke, nephew Logan,
        and countless family who love her so. We celebrate Larayne’s life and
        look forward with joy to meeting her again in some other way—a glimmer
        of pink glitter, a butterfly beating its wings, or in life’s most
        gracious and joyful teachers. A celebration of Larayne’s life will be
        held on June 10th, 2023 in Poway Community Center, San Diego from 2-4 pm
        and one in Texas on August 5th, 2023, with details to come.
